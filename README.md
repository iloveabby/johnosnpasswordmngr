This is a basic and pretty much unsecure password manager. It's entire purpose is to help me grow in my devolpment skills as a beginning programmer.
I think it's a tad bit bloated, but I can work on that. I hate bloat. Anyway, if you want to use this for a script of your own. Go right a head.
I'm hoping some day to add a encryption system and make a GUI version. By the way it's written in python3.9 so don't try to use it with 2.7.
